          <h2>WHAT WE DO</h2>
            <p>We believe that what we do is more important than who we are.

"Americans are throwing out the equivalent of $165 billion (of food) each year and it is estimated that annually more than 6 billion pounds of fresh produce goes unharvested or unsold."
<a href="http://bit.ly/1hIZx2z">Natural Resources Defense Council</a><br />

"Forty to 50 percent of food waste comes from consumers, and 50 to 60 percent from businesses."
<a href="http://fxn.ws/14LyeOo">Environmental Protection Agency</a><br />

"Over 97% of food waste generated ends up in the landfill; (It) breaks down anaerobically and produces methane, which is 21 times more potent than CO2 as a greenhouse gas."
Environmental Protection Agency<br />

"48.1 million Americans lived in food insecure households, including 32.8 million adults and 15.3 million children. 14 percent of households (17.4 million households) were food insecure, and 6 percent (6.9 million households) experienced very low food security."
<a href="http://1.usa.gov/1Ni4qeq">USDA Economic Research Service</a><br />

â€¦ and those statistics don't even include the homeless.</p>

<p>Our mission is to put a dent not only in hunger but in food waste and landfill pollution. By connecting businesses with those providing food for the needy we believe we can tackle environmental, social, and economic concerns, all at once. Add to that a crowd-sourced method of delivery and the winning never stops.

We endeavor to enlist caring, like-minded individuals to participate in this project. Whether you are a restaurant, caterer, cateree, grocer, shelter, soup kitchen, volunteer courier, or just have some general feedback about how we can make this project better, in the end, it is you that makes this project endure. Our hats off to you!</p>
